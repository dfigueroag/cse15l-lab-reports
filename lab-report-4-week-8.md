### **Test 1**

Snippet:

The expected output: ``` `google.com```, ```google.com```, ```ucsd.edu```

Test:

My implementation's failure:

***What change could be made to make the test pass?***

In this case, I simply created an ssh file to make a shortcut. It was the easiest of the three tasks, but finding the ssh folder on a mac proved to be quite the challenge. It works well, and I chose ```ieng6``` to be my alias.

### **Test 2**

Snippet:

The expected output: ```a.com```, ```a.com(())```, ```example.com```

Test:
